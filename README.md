# Challenge15RoboAdvisor
## This Challenge requires use of Amazon Lex to develop a bot to engage with Customer to acquire input and then design a portofolio based on the input recieved
## Step A : Development ofbot using Lex, This focuses on the chat and capture of input. This was relatively straight forward process
## Step B : Development of Lambda function to verify the inputs recieved, error checking and handling and execution of action or doing the design of Portfolio, THis was very time consuming as debugingAmazonLambda functions using the log files requires getting used to, Once I got used to it, it was not so badbut there has to be a better way to develop and debug moe complex Lambda fuctions


## Videoclips showing interactions with the bot for step A and Step are included in this Repository
